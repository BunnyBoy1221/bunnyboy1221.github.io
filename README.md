Flow

Okay! We're finally done. So, to start out, I should explain what Flow actually is. Flow is inspired mainly by Willowscript and Insanic, both made by @thealchemybook on TikTok. Some of it's notable features include the fact that it's written from right to left, the letters form a line through the center as you write them, and any double letters (ee) have the second letter replaced with a small x. The font for flow is located at [Fontstruct](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2535686/flow-146), or you can simply download the ttf file. 

Next, we have the... honestly just a Vigen√®re cipher with some minor differences. It was the first encryption method I thought of and while I knew it probably wasn't original I was happy enough with the fact I thought of it myself. 

Now, this isn't really intended to be used to encode all of your messages, but rather to standardize them. I'm making this to show to others so they can attempt to crack it, and I wanted to turn it into a font so they wouldn't have to wonder whether differences were a quirk of my writing or a separate character. The way I intended to use this was to put your message through the Key Encoder and then write that in Flow. The intention here is that you can't simply run a letter frequency algorithm to crack Flow. 

If you're curious, I do know that most of Flow's letters are pretty similar to those they represent, but I wanted to have meaning behind the symbols, which I consider to have paid off because I can write in Flow without looking at a key. Although, I should really stop rambling here. Hope you enjoy!
